### **Strategic Opportunity Prioritization Matrix**

**Automated Impact Assessment:**

```
Opportunity Scoring Algorithm:
STRATEGIC VALUE = (Viral Potential × Authority Building × Revenue Attribution × Implementation Ease × Competitive Advantage) / 5

Automated Priority Categories:
- TIER 1 (9-10): CRITICAL - Immediate implementation with maximum business impact
- TIER 2 (7-8): HIGH - Strategic development with clear competitive advantage
- TIER 3 (5-6): MEDIUM - Secondary priorities with moderate business value
- TIER 4 (3-4): LOW - Long-term considerations with resource dependencies
- TIER 5 (1-2): MINIMAL - Interesting but no immediate strategic application

Cross-Phase Correlation Analysis:
{
  "tier_1_opportunities": "critical_immediate_implementation",
  "tier_2_opportunities": "high_strategic_development",
  "tier_3_opportunities": "medium_secondary_priorities",
  "implementation_sequence": "automated_priority_optimization",
