## **DRAMA PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK (AUTOMATED SCORING)**

### **Automated Drama Impact Calculation:**

```
DRAMA IMPACT SCORING (1-10):
Testimonial Value = Emotional Intensity × Transformation Scope × Customer Credibility × Business Impact × Implementation Utility

AUTOMATED SCORING CRITERIA:
- 9-10: EXPLOSIVE - Crisis keywords, transformation language, specific results, emotional intensity markers
- 7-8: POWERFUL - Problem resolution, satisfaction indicators, recommendation language, credibility markers
- 5-6: ENGAGING - Positive experience, service quality, reliability mentions, moderate emotion
- 3-4: MODERATE - Basic satisfaction, standard service delivery, minimal emotion, generic praise
- 1-2: MINIMAL - Short reviews, no emotion, basic rating only, limited business value

EMOTIONAL INTENSITY KEYWORDS (Auto-Detection):
High Drama: "disaster," "crisis," "emergency," "panic," "nightmare," "saved," "rescued," "amazing"
Medium Drama: "problem," "issue," "frustrated," "concerned," "relieved," "satisfied," "impressed"
Low Drama: "good," "fine," "okay," "decent," "adequate," "standard," "basic"

```
